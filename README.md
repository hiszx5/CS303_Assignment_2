# CS303_Assignment_2
This assignment is an extension on assignment one for CS303. The program will now validate user input prior to calling two of the functions created previously.
Additionally, the program will now include abstract class definition with two child classes that are also tested in the main function.

Note: The data to populate the array was removed for this assignment to improve readability of screenshots. Program has been tested and is functional,
but will display 0's. To see array population working, please see assignment one.
